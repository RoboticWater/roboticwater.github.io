        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p><em>Grove </em>is a mobile app that shows all nearby
            restaurants that have vegan and vegetarian options. &quot;Options&quot; is critical here, because <em>Grove
            </em>doesn&#x27;t exclude restaurants that aren&#x27;t explicitly vegan or vegetarian, and instead displays
            the
            composition of each restaurant&#x27;s menu, so users can be confident that they can get a decent meal even
            at
            places that aren&#x27;t exclusively catering to their dietary preference. </p>
        <div class="image-box">

        </div>
        <p><em>Grove</em> is designed to be clean, yet information
            dense. Our research suggested that our users like to look at a restaurant&#x27;s menu before ordering, often
            at
            pictures of the menu items themselves, so we placed as much of that information as close to the surface of
            the
            interface as possible without sacrificing readability, and provided users with robust filtering
            functionality.
            We also made menu legibility a priority, clearly denoting vegan or vegetarian dishes with distinct
            iconography.
        </p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig2">
                <div class="fig-content">

                <!-- <div class="fig-meta"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic layout used to test backend</div> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Finally, <em>Grove</em> has an automated newsletter system,
            providing our users notifications on the restaurants they&#x27;ve passed by on a weekly (customizable)
            basis,
            helping them expand their horizons. </p>
        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>This project was structured into roughly 3 stages: research,
            design, and evaluation, with a heavy emphasis on on research. </p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig3">
                <div class="fig-content">

                <!-- <div class="fig-meta"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic layout used to test backend</div> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Problem Refinement</h2>
        <p>This project began with a broad prompt: help people discover
            nutritional information on the go, but before we could begin designing, we needed to thoroughly define who
            we were trying to help and what needs of theirs weren&#x27;t being met. We knew this meant we would need to
            restrict our scope from the initial problem statement. &quot;Nutrition on the go&quot; was simply too broad
            a topic to adequately define a user population, so we explored different stakeholders and contexts where
            nutrition is an issue.</p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig4">

                </div>
                <!-- <div class="fig-meta"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic layout used to test backend</div> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Ultimately we decided to focus our project on vegans and vegetarians, because people within our
            social circles and market research suggested that this kind of diet was growing, yet still had plenty of
            room for innovation.</p>
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Discovery</h3>
        <ul class="image-list">
            <li> <img src="./LitReview.png" alt="">
                <div class="text">We conducted a literature review, determining the demographic
                    characteristics of our user population,
                    exploring academic approaches to our problem space</div>
            </li>
            <li><img src="./CompAnalysis.png" alt="">
                <divv class="text">We performed a thorough analysis of existing solutions in the
                    vegan/vegetarian nutrition space,
                    pinpointing
                    the benefits these systems already provide, and more importantly, what they didn't</divv>
            </li>
            <li><img src="./Interviews.png" alt="">
                <div class="text">Finally, and most critically, we held 5 30-60 minute semi-structured
                    interviews with our user
                    population,
                    discovering their needs and pain points and then mapping their entire journey from finding to eating
                    at
                    a
                    restaurant</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig5">
                <div class="fig-content">
                    <img src="./R2 Affinity Map.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
                </div>
                <!-- <div class="fig-meta"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic layout used to test backend</div> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>We then took all of our findings and organized them into
            user personas and a journey map, so we could give our problem space some structure. The former codified the
            desires, abilities, and backgrounds of our users so we could maintain a coherent image of who we were
            developing
            for, and the latter fleshed out every step in the process of eating out, from deciding where to eat to
            completing the order so we could clearly address every pain point.</p>

            <div class="figure" id="fig6">

                <!-- <div class="fig-meta"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic layout used to test backend</div> -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Refinement</h3>
        <p>With the journey map in hand, we conducted a second round of
            interviews, asking individuals in our target population to critique our distillation of their experience
            dining
            out. </p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig7>
                <div class=" fig-content">
                <img src="./R2 WIP Final Current State Map.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>While we were confident in our investigation of the problem
            space, we had yet to find a context specific enough to where we could begin the design process. There
            were
            simply too many pain points throughout the process to choose, so we conducted an online survey to let
            our
            users
            decide. We deployed a Qualtrics survey to the r/vegan subreddit and various Georgia Tech social media
            venues
            to
            determine which of our pain points were felt the most by our users. </p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig8>
                    <div class=" fig-content">
                <img src="./Qualtrics.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The results of the survey and the journey map critique
            suggested that our users experienced the most potent pain points during the discovery phase, so
            that&#x27;s
            what
            we started to design for. </p>

        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig8>
                        <div class=" fig-content">
                <img src="./R2 Workshop Current State Map_ZOM.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>Our design process was iterative, taking user and expert
            feedback at each step to refine our ideas until they could be realized as a medium fidelity prototype.
        </p>
        <h3>Sketches</h3>
        <p>After brainstorming ideas, we decided to move forward with
            3. We developed simple storyboard sketches for each idea, and presented them to prospective users,
            asking
            them
            to identify aspects they liked, disliked, or thought could be developed more.</p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig8>
                            <div class=" fig-content">

            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Wireframes</h3>
        <p>With the feedback from the sketch workshop, we iterated on
            each idea and created a rough wireframe for each, and performed a task-based analysis with users. Here we
            discovered more technical problems with our concepts, like confusion with visual elements and UI flow.</p>
        <div class="image-box">
            <div class="figure" id="fig8>
                            <div class=" fig-content">
                <img src="./Wireframes User Feedback Sessions.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <h3>Prototype</h3>
        <p>Taking the best qualities from our wireframes, we went to
            Figma and began to develop a medium fidelity prototype. This is where I contributed most to this
            project,
            designing the app&#x27;s visual identity, and developing most of its functionality.</p>
        <div class="image-box">

            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Finally, we took prototype and subjected it to both
            usability testing with prospective users and heuristic evaluations with experts. </p>
